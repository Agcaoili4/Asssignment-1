Assignment one for Intro to Web Programming

# OBJECTIVE
In this assignment, you are required to code a set of JavaScript functions and objects. You can use any editor to write the functions.

# TASKS
# 1. Create a personal profile page with any kind of style. (20 marks)
This page must include, at least:
•
1 picture that appears after 10 seconds. (10 marks)
•
2 paragraphs of text. (2.5 marks)
•
A header with navigation bar (with links to the pages you will create for the other questions). (2.5 marks)
•
A footer with copyright information and the current date (check item 5). (5 marks)
# 2. Build a Mark to Grade converter page (20 marks)
• The MarkToGrade function scrapes the student mark out of the mark-input-box element and verifies it is realistic. (5 marks) • A mark must be numerical, nonnegative, and less or equal to 100. (2.5 marks) • If an invalid mark is entered, it displays a message back to the user in the validation- message element. (5 marks) • Messages should be informative. Return as many different messages as you can to guide the user what kind of erroneous value was entered. (2.5 marks)
The correct grade is displayed. Use these values to convert grades: (5 marks)
•
A: grade ≥ 90
•
B: 80 ≤ grade < 90
•
C: 70 ≤ grade < 80
•
D: 60 ≤ grade < 70
•
E: 50 ≤ grade < 60
•
F: grade < 50
Hints: You can use the global parseInt function to try and convert a string to a number. You can use exception handling to handle invalid values.
