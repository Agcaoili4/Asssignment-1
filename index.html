            Hello! My name is Jansen, an aspiring Full Stack Developer. Welcome
            to another one of my creations! Designing websites isn’t just about
            coding and aesthetics; it’s also about understanding and addressing
            each unique need for a specific purpose. As a Software Development
            student at Bow Valley College with a GPA of 3.87, I have hands-on
            experience in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, creating dynamic,
            user-friendly websites. In one project, I developed a website from
            scratch, ensuring it met the unique objectives of having an
            interactive interface while enhancing the user experience through
            thoughtful design and coding.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Beyond my academic achievements, I have taken on leadership roles,
            such as serving as President of the Hack Masters Club, where I
            mentor fellow students and foster collaboration. My involvement in
            organizing events like Hack-cess Mania and HACKTOBERFEST has further
            developed my skills in teamwork and project management. I also had
            another opportunity to show my teamwork and showcase my coding
            ability by being a web designer/developer for Affinity Mentorship
            Foundation, a non-profit organization dedicated to helping young
            children grow well and have a better life.
